    "#### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "We developed a genetic algorithm to efficiently search through large parameter space for designing our digit automata. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts with an initial population of automata designs generated from a random seed. Each design within the population is then simulated to find all possible geometric outputs upon sixteen actuation combination and scored with a deep learning model. During the scoring process, to fully utilize each image, all images are rotated with twenty different degrees and the image with the highest score as a digit is selected to represent the final class and score of the image. We thus get a 2d array documenting what digits are formed and the score for each digits. \n",
    "\n",
    "We next developed a custom loss function to evaluate the performance of each design. We define the loss function as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Loss = 5000 * (number\\_of\\_digits\\_formed) * \\sum_{i = 0}^{i = 9}[1.001 - (score\\_for\\_digit\\_i)]$\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function computes the **diversity** and the **similarity to real digits** for the digits formed. Designs that outputs images resembling a larger number of high-quality digits are more likely to be preserved. During the selection stage, we eliminate 80% of the designs within the population, by selecting the designs that have the 20% lowest loss score. These designs are sent into a mutation function to repopulate a new generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the mutation function, we used the **single-parent mutation method** where the genetic information of each descendant come from a single survived design from previous selection. During mutation, each design has a fifty percent chance to randomly update the strip segment lengths, preserving the actuator pattern information; each design also has a fifty percent chance of mutating the actuator pattern, where we randomly mutate half of the pattern. Each survivor design generates four descendants, so the population returns to its original size after every round of selection and mutation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the algorithm iterates the cylce of population generation, selection and mutation until reaching generation limit and outputs the optimized designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our even digit automata and odd digit automata search, we slighlty tweaked the loss function and mutation function to obtain fabricable results. We first included an additional rule within the mutation function to ensure new design are within reasonable patterning steps to avoid generating designs overly complex and un-patternable. We developed a custom fabrication step calculation function `fab_steps_strip_requires` - calculating the sumulative sum of unique actuator systems within each layer, and eliminating mutations that requires more than six fabrication steps. As this step limits the complexity of outputs formed, we aimed to search for patterning an even digit automata and an odd digit automata, changing the loss functions for the two search and derived the final optimized outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Loss = 5000 * (number\\_of\\_digits\\_formed) * \\sum_{i = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9}[1.001 - (score\\_for\\_digit\\_i)]$\n",
    "\n",
    "$Loss = 5000 * (number\\_of\\_digits\\_formed) * \\sum_{i = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8}[1.001 - (score\\_for\\_digit\\_i)]$\n",
